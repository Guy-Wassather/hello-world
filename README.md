# hello-world
My first repository.
I have been teaching elementary school for the past 6 years. After a lot of consideration, I have decided to leave public education; I am currently exploring a career in either user experience research/ design, or programming. This is my first gitHub experience, but I expect I will be using this a lot as I continue to learn.

I have been exploring javascript, html/css, arduino tinkering (c?), and python to a lesser extent. So far, I am having a blast learning the basics of programming, and am trying to decide if this is something I would want to make a career out of. 

Also, I like snakes, learning, hiking, whittling, climbing, whiskey, beer, reading, and writing.
